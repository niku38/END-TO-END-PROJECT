## 📌 Objective
Analyze vendor and product performance using sales and inventory data to improve profitability and operational efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, SQLite, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Custom ETL scripts
- SQL for querying structured data

## 📂 Project Highlights
- Built a Python script to automate data loading from CSV to SQLite database using a custom ETL pipeline (`ingestion_db.py`)
- Generated vendor performance summaries by merging sales, purchase, and freight data (`get_vendor_summary.py`)
- Analyzed sales and inventory data to track vendor and product performance
- Measured key business metrics: profit margin, inventory turnover, sales-to-purchase ratio
- Identified problems like slow-moving products and over-reliance on few vendors
- Suggested actions: price adjustments, vendor diversification, and improved inventory control

## 📈 Impact
Helped identify underperforming products and vendors, leading to more informed business decisions on pricing and inventory planning.
